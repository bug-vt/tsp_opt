# Assignment P3 â€“ TSP optimizations
### Bug Lee (7225881)

## How to run:
The program was built and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 OS. 
To get the TSP measurement, run 

./make.sh

inside the terminal.

The following TSP will run in order:
1. Brute force with O3 flag for size n=8 to n=13
2. Optimized TSP for size n=10 to n=30
3. Parallel optimized TSP for size n=10 to n=30
